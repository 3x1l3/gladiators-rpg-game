This was my attempt at creating an XML parser.

It doesn't work with more than one level on one line, nor with preceeding whitespace.

One simply needs to add list support to make it utilitous.
However, with PUGIXML working, this is redundant/useless code.

But I put it here for reference. Maybe it'll have some use later.
